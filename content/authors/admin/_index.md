## About Me

Hey, I am Zhuoyue! Iâ€™m a DPhil student in the [EPSRC CDT in Statistics and Machine Learning (StatML)](https://statml.io) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), where Iâ€™m advised by [Tom Rainforth](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~twgr/). My work focuses on probabilistic machine learning, with current projects on Bayesian active learning.
