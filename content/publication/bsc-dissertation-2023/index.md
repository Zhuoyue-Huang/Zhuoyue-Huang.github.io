abstract: This dissertation develops and implements a Python-based signature inversion framework using recursive basis-expansion formulas for arbitrary measures and multidimensional paths. The work provides theoretical foundations for signature inversion methods and demonstrates superior accuracy compared to traditional insertion methods. The framework handles complex geometric structures in path spaces through orthogonal polynomial bases, offering both computational efficiency and mathematical rigor.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: A comprehensive study of signature inversion methods using orthogonal polynomial bases, with practical implementations and theoretical analysis.
