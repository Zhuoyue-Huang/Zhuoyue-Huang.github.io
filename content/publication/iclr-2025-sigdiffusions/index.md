abstract: We present SigDiffusions, a novel approach that combines score-based diffusion models with log-signature embeddings for time series generation and modeling. By leveraging the mathematical framework of signatures, we capture the intrinsic geometric properties of time series paths while maintaining the generative power of diffusion models. Our method demonstrates superior performance on various time series tasks, offering both theoretical guarantees and practical advantages over existing approaches.

This work introduces SigDiffusions, a groundbreaking method that bridges the gap between the rich mathematical theory of signatures and the powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models for time series data.

The log-signature embedding provides a principled way to capture the essential characteristics of temporal sequences while preserving their geometric structure. When combined with score-based diffusion models, this approach enables robust generation and modeling of complex time series patterns.

Key contributions include:
- A novel framework combining signature methods with diffusion models
- Theoretical analysis of the approach's properties
- Empirical validation on diverse time series datasets
- Demonstration of improved performance over existing methods
